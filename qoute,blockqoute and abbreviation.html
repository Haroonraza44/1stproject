    <h1>Blockquote &lt; blockquote&gt;</h1>
<p> the content of the &lt;em &gt; element is shown in italics, and a <b>blockquote</b>  is usually indented. But you should not use them to change the way thatyour text looks; their purpose is  to describe the content of your web pages more accurately.The reason for using these elements is that other programs, such as screen readers or search engines, can use this extra information.
For example, the voice of a screen reader may add  emphasis to the words inside the em element, or a search engine might register that your page features a quote if you uses the &lt; blockquote &gt; element.
<blockquote> This paragraph is quoted using blockquote</blockquote>
<hr>
<h1> Quote tag &lt;q&gt;</h1>
<p> The &lt;q &gt;is used for shorter quotes that sit withina paragraph. Browsers are supposed to put quotes around
the &lt;q&gt; element, however Internet Explorer does not. </p>
 <q> THIS IS A QUOTE</q>

<hr>
<h1>Abbreviation &lt;abbr &gt;</h1>
<p>
If you use an abbreviation or an acronym, then the <b>&lt;abbr &gt;</b>
element can be used. A title attribute on the opening tag is
used to specify the full term. e.g. 
<abbr title="Pakistan Super League"> <b>PSL</b></abbr>
